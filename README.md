Forked from the wireless version by Scott216: https://github.com/Scott216/Weather_Upload_RPi/

This modified project is for the wired verions of the Davis Vantage Pro 2 - Davic 6322C.

A RS485 module receives the data directly from the weather station through a RJ11 cable with the following pinout:
    1 = Black = +5V
    2 = Red = B
    3 = Green = A
    4 = Yellow = GND
